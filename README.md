# CombineUnsplash

A sample project exploring [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)/[Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) and [Result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result), using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) API (via [Picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos) API)

As [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is a new paradigm shift since the introduction of Swift, and it's relative new, so we as [community](https://github.com/Juanpe/About-SwiftUI) are learning and exploring how to use it day by day.

Here, I combine (no pun intended) SwiftUI and Combine for view and model binding by using Picsum.photos API, using Swift's Result for network completion handler.

In every steps, I try to write comment on how and why to do it. 

I hope this sample is useful to both me and everyone for reference.

(note: I'm still learning about SwiftUI and Combine, so I will try to update this sample when I learn new things about it from WWDC sessions) :smile:

A full-fledged Combine example look something like: 

+ https://github.com/kitasuke/SwiftUI-MVVM
+ https://github.com/marty-suzuki/GitHubSearchWithSwiftUI
+ https://github.com/sergdort/CombineFeedback

It's much more complex than my sample, but here I just want to point out the "basic" way to do Combine. If you're interested in a completed Combine examples, definitely check those out.
